"I'm currently seeing Rachelle for IBE Extensions and she is INCREDIBLE. I have very fine + thin hair and she has worked miracles, so incredibly talented. She is passionate about what she does, super easy to talk to and always takes time to teach me techniques for styling + hair care.
-KRISTI<br><br>

"Rachelle is a Hair Goddess! I have gone from bright blonde with extensions to this new luscious BRONDE! I wouldn't trust anyone else with my hair. She is also the sweetest and makes the appointments so fun we can chat about anything!"
-RHIANNA<br><br>
 
"Wow oh wow! Where do I even start? I absolutely love this salon, the vibe, the people, and most importantly my girl, Rachelle Idler who is the hair Queen. Rachelle is amazing at what she does and always ensure you not only look your best but also feel your absolute best throughout your entire appointment. I'm so blessed that I have found this salon and Rachelle. I always look forwards to my appointments! Thank you x100, Rachelle! You're a dream!

<h3>A LITTLE BIT ABOUT EXTENSIONS...</h3><br>
Invisible Bead Extensions will change your life! Whether you're seeking the confidence boost of fuller hair or looking to add several inches of length, Invisible Bead Extensions are the safest and most natural looking extension method available today! I have been certified in other hand tied extension methods and IBE blew me out of the water. With IBE you will not experience damage to your hair/scalp or any discomfort. What my clients do experience is growth and healthy hair. Once the hand tied extensions are in place, they look and feel completely natural. They can be colored, washed, curled, and styled just like natural hair. This flexibility, comfort and freedom makes hand tied extensions a top choice for many different lifestyles. 
<br>
PLEASE NOTE - A 50% DEPOSIT IS DUE AT THE TIME OF BOOKING FOR ALL EXTENSIONS<br><br>

<h3>PRICING PACKAGES</h3><br><br>
Pricing completely depends on your hair goals and will vary per client. I always do a consultation to color match and go over the final cost. 

Installation, hair cost & a haircut are included in prices quotes listed below.

All packages require a 50% non-refundable deposit at the time of booking. <br><br>

<h3>NEW CLIENTS</h3><br>
I would love to take everyone on as a new client, but with limited availability in my schedule I am only accepting a select few new guests at this time. <br>

​

For now, I am happily accepting new guests for extensions and color only. Thank you for understanding!<br><br>


​

If this fits you, please request an appointment as

I am more than happy to see if we are a good fit at this time.

Please keep in mind, I am booked roughly 6-8 weeks out.

Majority of my existing guests prebook their

appointments months in advance so there

may be a waiting list, however, if something

comes up I will add you to it and pull from it.

Thank you for understanding.<br><br>

​

Please allow 24-48 hours for me to respond,

I try to do my best balancing work and family life.
